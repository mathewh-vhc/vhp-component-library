~~**1.** Add styles to repo~~

~~**2.** Reorganize styles to have individual files for each basic component~~

**3.** Create a Vogel React Template to branch off of instead of using create-react-app (so our customized App.js is present and user does not worry about creating initial apps - maybe a command line script that generates the app?)

**4.** Test support for minimizing in CardTitlebar
